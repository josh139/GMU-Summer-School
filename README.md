# GMU-Summer-School
These are the projects I made during a two-week summer program in which I learnt how to build machine learning models using Python. The program ran virtually in 
partnership with George Mason University (US) between July 19th - 30th 2021.

## IDLE (Week 1)
This Introduction to Python for Machine-Learning/AI week-long course prepares high school and adult students to learn the Python programming language from scratch, but 
also includes an overview of data science and machine-learning/AI using Python. Moreover, learners are given a range of simple to increasingly difficult programming 
projects in class through an introduction of a range of open-source Python tools, modules, and libraries used in data analysis and machine-learning. This course 
culminates in a fun and challenging project to build a classification machine-learning model to analyze movie reviews.

## Spyder (Week 2)
Machine-Learning/AI with Python is the second course of a two weeks series that introduces high school and adult students to machine-learning programming with Python. 
This course assumes students have a solid grasp of intermediate-to-advanced Python, as dataset analysis and machine-learning projects are introduced in the first two 
days. As all machine-learning models must be trained, trimmed, and corrected using clean and complete datasets, so this course begins with an introduction to data 
science, data classification, data analytics, and dataset compilation. A series of machine-learning/AI algorithms and techniques such as Random Forest, SVM, SVP, 
Na√Øve Bayes, nearest neighbor variants, and TensorFlow will be presented through discussions and projects. Moreover, a description and related projects will be assigned 
using a series of related open-source modules and libraries, such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Pygame, Keras, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, and VADER. This course 
culminates in a capstone project to build and customize a neural-network machine-learning powered arcade space shooter.
